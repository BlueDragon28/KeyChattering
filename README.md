# KeyChattering
A program to delete double key entry (key chattering) on mechanical keyboard. It's working on Windows (tested on Windows 10). Keep in mind that is a dirty way to eliminate key chattering and may cause some glitch with the keyboard.

# How to use

You can run the program without arguments, it will block by default all the new key pressed in a time below 50 millisecond from the previous same key. To close the program while it running, press the key combination **Ctrl+C** while focused to the console.

## Command line options

- `--time=arg` or `-t arg` to set the chatter time in milliseconds.
- `--debug` or `-d` show debug output information when a key chatter is detected.
- `--help` or `-h` show help information about command line options.

# Installation
To install the program you need:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with C++11 compiler.
- [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts) C++ library. 

Clone the repository with git:
```
git clone https://github.com/Erwan28250/KeyChattering.git
```
or by downloading a [zip](https://github.com/Erwan28250/KeyChattering/archive/refs/heads/development.zip) of the code.

Create inside the root directory a **dependencies** directory and clone the [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts) library inside it.

In the root directory, create a build directory, navigate into it and run CMake:
```
cmake ..\ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
You can then compile the program using the visual studio project generated by CMake. You will find the binary inside the bin directory.
